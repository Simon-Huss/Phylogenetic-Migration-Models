# Phylogenetic-Migration-Models

This repository contains the code used in the bachelor thesis *Continuous Approximations of Discrete Phylogenetic Migration Models* by myself (Simon Huss) and Theodor Mosetti Bj√∂rk. It is written in Julia and utilizes the framework [MolecularEvolution.jl](https://github.com/MurrellGroup/MolecularEvolution.jl).
